# Week 2 Project: Build the charity: water Landing Page
To get started, create a new Codespace from this repo.

In this Project, you’ll transform your Canva mockup into a fully functional landing page using HTML and CSS. This is your chance to take your creative concept — with your brand visuals, your messaging, and your imagery — and make it real. You'll build a site that not only looks great, but also educates, inspires, and drives action.

With help from AI to jumpstart your layout, you'll focus on structuring your content, applying your brand style, and creating a polished final product that reflects your vision. By the end of this Project, you’ll have a live, interactive page deployed to the web. You can share this work when you want to showcase your technical skills and your passion for digital storytelling.

## Preview locally

To view the page on your machine while you work, run a simple static server from the project root and open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Python 3 (quick):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Node (if you prefer):

```bash
npx http-server -c-1
```

Where to edit visual pieces
- `styles.css` — main stylesheet (brand colors are at the top using CSS custom properties).
- `index.html` — page structure and content (hero headline, donation amounts, etc.).
- `img/` — images used by the page (replace `img/cw-logo.png` or the hero background URL in `styles.css`).

If you'd like the classroom page to look exactly like the previous internal style, I merged the original header/hero and donate styles into `styles.css` and kept explanatory comments so you (or students) can learn how each part works.
